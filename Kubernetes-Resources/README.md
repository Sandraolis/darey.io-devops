# Working with Kubernetes Resources

## Introduction To YAML

A Kubernetes **YAML file** is a text file written in **YAML syntax** that describes and defines Kubernetes resources. YAML is a human-readable data serialization format that is commonly used for configuration files.

In the context of Kubernetes, these YAML files serve as a declarative way to specify the desired state of the resources such as pods, container, service and deployment you want to deploy and manage within a Kubernetes cluster.

## Basic Structure Of YAML File

YAML uses indentation to represent the hierarchy of data, and it uses whitespace (usually spaces, not tabs) for indentation

``` bash
key1: value1
key2:
  subkey1: subvalue1
  subkey2: subvalue2
key3:
  - item1
  - item2
```

## Data Types

**Scalar** scalar are single values.

- Strings:

``` bash
name: John Doe
```

- Number:

``` bash
age: 25
```

- Booleans:

``` bash
is_student: true
```

**Collector**

List: (arrays):

``` bash
fruits:
  - apple
  - banana
  - orange
```

- Maps (key-value pairs):

``` bash
person:
  name: Alice
  age: 30
```

- **Nested Structure**: YAML allows nesting structures:

``` bash
employee:
  name: John Doe
  position: developer
  skills:
    - Python
    - JavaScript
```

- **Comments:** In YAML, comment start with **#**

``` bash
# This is a comment
key: value
```

- **Multiline Strings:** Multiline strings can be represented using `|` or `>` characters:

``` bash
description: |
  This is a multiline
  string in YAML.
```

- **Anchors and Aliases**: You can use `&` to create an anchor and `*` to create an alias:

``` bash
first: &name John
second: *name
```

So this is more like setting a variables. In this example, **second** has the same value as **first**.

Now that we've got the basic, practice and reading YAML to become confortable with its syntax. It's widely used in configuration files for various tools and systems.


# Deploying Applications in Kubernetes

In Kubernetes, deploying applications is a fundemental skills. Deployment involves the process of taking your application code and running it on a Kubernetes cluster, ensuring that it scales, manages resource efficiently, and stays resilient. This hand-on project will guild me through deploying application using Minikube, a lightweight, single-node Kubernetes cluster perfect for development or testing.

# Deployments in Kubernetes

In Kubernetes, a **Deployment is a declarative approach to managing and scaling applications. It provides a blueprint for the desired state of the application, allowing Kubernetes to handle the complexities of deploying and managing replicas. Whether you're running a sinple web serber or a more complex microservices architecture, Deployment are the cornerstone for maintaining application consistency and availability.


# Service in Kubernetes

Once the application is deployed, it needs a way to be accessed by other perts of the system or external users. This is where Service comes into play. In Kubernetes, a Service is an abstraction that defines a logical set of Pods and a policy by which to access them. It acts as a stable endpoint to connect to the application, allowing for easy communication within the cluster or external sources. Some of the several types of Services in Kubernets;

- **ClusterIP:** Purpose: The default type. Expose the service in a cluster internal IP. Accessible only within the cluster.

- **NodePort:** Exposes the Service on each Node's IP at a static port (NodePort). Accessible externally using **NodeIP**.

- **LoadBalancer:** Exposes the Service externally using a cloud provider's load balancer. Accessible externally through the load balancer's IP.

In subsequent sections. I will dive deep into deployment strategies and service configuration within the kubernetes ecosystem, delving into the intricacies of these componenets to ensure a thorough understanding and proficiency in their utilization.

**Deploying a Minikube Sample Application:** Using YAML files for deployments and services in Kubernetes is like cratfting a detailed plan of the application, while direct deployment with `kubectl` commands is more like giving quick, on-the-spot intructions to launch and manage the application. Let's create a minikube deployment and service with `kubectl`.


``` bash
kubectl create deployment hello-minikube --image=kicbase/echo-server:1.0
```

![](./Images/1.%20kubectl.png)

The command above creates a Kubernetes Deployment named "hello-minikube" running the "kicbase/echo-server:1.0" container image

``` bash
kubectl expose deployment hello-minikube --type=NodePort --port=8080
```

The command above exposes the Kubernetes Deployment named "hello-minikube" as a NodePort service on port 8080.

``` bash
kubectl get services hello-minikube
```

![](./Images/2.%20kubectl-expose.png)


The easiest way to acccess this service is to let minikube launch a web browser for you

``` bash
minikube service hello-minikube 
```

![](./Images/3.%208080.png)


- **Note:** If the web browser can't be open because of no GUI on my environment. So what I will do is to tunnel the minikube port to another VM that has GUI installed. `Minikube uses a private network interface, and when you forward a port (via SSH tunnel or minikube service), it binds to localhost (127.0.0.1) by default â€” not the VM's IP address. This is possible by using putty SSH TUNNEL`

# Working With YAML Files

I already have an image push to dockerhub. Now we are going to reuse the image in our YAMl script for deployment.

# Step

1. Create a new folder I will use for this project which I named my-nginx-yaml and also navigate to the directory.

``` bash
mkdir my-nginx-yaml
cd my-nginx-yaml
```

![](./Images/6.%20nginx.png)


2. Then I created a new file inside the directory I created in the first step, which is name `nginx-deployment.yaml`

``` bash
apiVersion: apps/v1
kind: Deployment
metadata:
  name: my-nginx-deployment
spec:
  replicas: 1
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      app: my-nginx
  template:
    metadata:
      labels:
        app: my-nginx
    spec:
      containers:
      - name: my-nginx
        image: dareyregistry/my-nginx:1.0
        ports:
        - containerPort: 80
```

![](./Images/7.%20vi.png)


The provided YAML snippet defines a Kubernetes Deployment for deploying an instance of the Nginx web server. Let's break down the key components:

**apiVersion YAML/vi:** Specifies the Kubernetes API version for the object being created, in this case, a Deployment in the "apps" group.

**kind: Deployment:** Defines the type of Kubernetes resource being created, which is a Deployment. Deployment are used to manage the deployment and scaling of applications.

**metedata:** Contains metedatas for Deployment, including the name of the Deployment, which is set to "my-nginx-deployment."

**spec:** Describe the desired state of the Deployment.

**replicas: 1:** Specifies that the desired number of replicas (instances) of the Pods controlled by this Deployment is 1.

**selector:** Defines how the Deployment selects which Pods to manage. In this case. it uses the label "app:my-nginx" to match Pods.

**templete:** Specfies the templete for creating new Pods.

**metedata:** Contains label for the Pods, and in this case, the label is set to "app: my-nginx".

**spec:** Describe the Pods specification.

**containers:** Defines the containers within the Pod.

**name: my-nginx:** Sets the name of the container to "my-nginx".

**image: dareyregistry/my-nginx:1.0:** Specifies the Docker images to be used for the Nginx container. The container. The image is "ridwanaz/my-nginx" with version "1.0".

**ports:** Specifies the port mapping for the conntainer, and in this case, it expose port 80.


3. Created a new file which I called `nginx-service.yaml` and paste the content below

``` bash
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: my-nginx-service
spec:
  selector:
    app: my-nginx
  ports:
    - protocol: TCP
      port: 80
      targetPort: 80
  type: NodePort
```

![](./Images/8.%20nginx-service.png)


The provided YAML snippet defines a Kubernetes Service for exposing the Nginx application to the external world. Let's break down the key components:

**apiVersion:** v1: Specifies the Kubernetes API version for the object being created, in this case, a Service.

**kind: Service:** Define the type of Kubernetes resource being created, which is a Service. Service provide n a stable endpoint for accessing a set of Pods.

**metedata:** Contains metedata for the Service, including the name of the Service, which is set to "my-nginc-service".

**spec:** Describe the desired state of the Service.

**selector:** Specifies the labels used to select which Pods the Service will route traffic to. In this case, it selects Pods with the label "app: my-nginx".

**ports:** Specifies the ports configuration for the Service.

**protocol:** TCP: Specifies the transport layer protocol, which is TCP in this case.

**port:** 80: Defines the port on which the Service will exposed.

**tergetPort:** 80: Specifies the port on the Pods to which the traffic will be forwarded.

**type: NodePort:** Sets the type of the Service to NodePort. This means that the Service will be accessiblr externally on each Node's IP address at a static port, which will be automatically assigned unless specified.


4. After defining both my deployment and service YAML file then I run the command below.

``` bash
kubectl apply -f nginx-deployment.yaml

kubectl apply -f nginx-service.yaml
```

5. Verify the deployment

``` bash
kubectl get deployments

kubectl get services
```

![](./Images/9.%20kubectl-apply.png)


6. Then I access my deployment on the web browser.

``` bash
minikube service my-nginx-service --url
```

![](./Images/10.%20url.png)

7. Then I opened my web browser and input this URL http://127.0.0.1:32446.
