# Adding Comment in Bash Script

Comments are essential in programming, serving as notes to the programmer and anyone else who might read the code.

They explain what the script or parts of the script do, making the code easier to understand and maintain. This section will guide you on how to add comments in Bash scripts.

### What Are Comments?

Comments are lines in your code that are ignored by the interpreter. In `Bash scripts`, comments help document the purpose and logic of your code, making it easier for others to follow and understand the script's functionality.

### Single-Line Comments

Single-line comment in Bash starts with the `#` symbol. Anything following this symbol on the same line is treated as a comment and is not executed.

#### Using multiple Single-Line comments:
